    <div class="content">
        <p>
            IAESTE is an international association that organizes international internships primarily for 
            students in STEM disciplines (science, engineering, architecture, and math), business, and 
            other professional fields. In each country, there is a National Committee (NC) as well as 
            a number of local committees (LC). The National Committee is in charge of the entire 
            country’s operations, whereas the local committees are student groups at universities 
            throughout the country. These committees work together to ensure IAESTE Canada is functioning 
            efficiently. The main role of the Local Committees is to encourage Canadian employers to 
            participate in the IAESTE program. Since the IAESTE system is based on a direct exchange, 
            the more international students we can bring into Canada means the more Canadian students 
            we can send abroad. Overall, IAESTE is a great way to meet people in your country as well 
            as internationally. It encompasses it’s core values of professionalism, international 
            cooperation and friendship in every way. Do you want to be apart of the IAESTE family?
